# snake_game

This final "Reinforcement Learning course" project focuses on the artificial intelligence of the **"Snake Game"**. Essence of the game is a piece of cake: snake eats the food that arises on the field and fill the map of its bodies as soon as possible. 

We have implemented three algorithms:
* Value Iteration
* Policy Iteration
* Simple Multi-Layer perceptron

In order to estimate the perfomance of each algorithm we have conducted an experiments, using the following metrics:
* **Steps per food**: How many steps it took on average for the snake to eat food;
* **Average length**: Average length of the snake during the game;
